### Strategist's portfolio juggling spooks investors as Nasdaq and Dow fall

> NEW YORK (CNNfn) - Investors heeded one of Wall Street's best-known market strategists Tuesday, reducing stock positions after Abby Joseph Cohen advised such a move.

> Cohen, investment strategist at Goldman Sachs, also warned that high-flying technology shares might not have much room left to grow.

> But in a quiet news period after the Federal Reserve's latest interest-rate hike and ahead of first-quarter earnings reporting season, analysts said Cohen's comments met a market looking any reasons to buy or sell.

> The standstill comes as oil prices tripled during the last 12 months, a development analysts fear could hurt profits across many industries and spark an outbreak of inflation.

> In the week's mostly closely watched economic indicator, the jobs report for March failed to show the kind of strength that makes Wall Street fret about rising inflation.

> While the U.S. economy created 416,000 jobs in March, above forecasts, the figures included one-time anomalies. The government hired 117,000 census takers in the period. And because March was five weeks long, another 50,000 to 100,000 positions were added to the total, the Labor Department said.

> Wall Street focused more closely on news that the unemployment rate did not fall as expected, but held steady at 4.1 percent. Wage inflation, meanwhile, did not rise with any significance, climbing 0.4 percent.

### Unnerved investors rapidly unload stocks amid inflationary fears

> **Friday's plunge came after the government said prices at the consumer level showed surprising strength last month, triggering fears that the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates more aggressively.**

### Inflationary woes prompt 'old economy' sell-off of the Dow industrials

> NEW YORK (CNNfn) - Attention shifted to inflationary concerns Friday as the week's economic indicators suggested the white-hot economy is not about to burn out, prompting investors to snap up technology shares and dump interest-rate sensitive "old economy" issues.

> "Higher interest rates are an impediment to companies where cost is important and that's old economy stocks," said Barry Hyman, chief market strategist at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum Inc. "What we are seeing is a defensive move into technology stocks."

"It's a similar rotation that began yesterday (Thursday). People are concerned about inflation."

## U.S. Stock-Index Futures Rise as Report Shows April Retail Sales Fell (Bloomberg)

> New York, May 11 (Bloomberg) - U.S. stocks gained after a report showed April retail sales dropped from the month before. The report eased some concerns that strong consumer spending could spur inflation and push interest rates higher.

> Intel Corp. and Cisco Systems Inc., the largest companies in the Nasdaq Composite Index, rose. The report showed sales at U.S. retailers fell last month for the first time in a year and a half.

> The unexpected drop in retail sales "gives a sign that the economy is starting to slow a little," said Richard Cripps, chief market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker in Baltimore. "The
Fed won't have to be as aggressive."

> The Federal Reserve is expected to raise short-term interest rates by as much as half a point on May 16. "A 50 basis-point rise looks factored into the market now," said Jacques-Antoine Bretteil, who helps manage $700 million at International Capital Gestion in Paris. "If the Fed raises rates more than that the market will really take a blow." Rising interest rates tend to penalize stocks that are most expensive relative to their earnings, he said.

## U.S. Stocks Fall, Led by Intel, GE; Nasdaq Composite Loses 3.9% for Week (Bloomberg)

> New York, May 19 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. stocks fell, led by Intel Corp. and General Electric Co., on expectations the Federal Reserve will keep raising interest rates this year, slowing the economy and reducing corporate revenue and profit growth. 
"Investors have been justifying paying extraordinary prices for tech stocks because of the expectation for continued revenue growth," said Charles Crane, market strategist at Spears, Benzak, Salomon & Farrell Inc., which manages $5 billion. "Any threat to that growth" puts technology shares in trouble.

> The Nasdaq fell three straight days, with technology shares leading the losses, after the Federal Reserve said Tuesday it will raise interest rates to hold inflation in check, even as it boosted rates for the sixth time since June. 
"Tech companies themselves aren't heavy borrowers, but their customers are going to be hurt by higher interest rates" and reduce spending on technology, said Crane.

Compare this narrative to just a month ago 2000-04-28, a complete U-turn on tech stocks and interest rates. Now apparently, high interests are bad for growth stocks.

> Cisco fell 1 15/16 to 53 7/16 and was the most active stock, as it has been every day this week. The No. 1 computer-networking equipment maker, which rose 50 percent in the first three months of the year, has wiped out all of that gain and is now the third most valuable company in the S&P; 500 behind General Electric Co. and Intel.
**"I sold the last of my Cisco yesterday," said Johan Vystavel, a fund manager at HWB Capital Management, in Surrey, England. "I got out above purchase price. It's a good company, but at 100 times earnings it's just too expensive."** The shares trade for 103 times profit.

> U.S. commercial banks themselves are taking a more conservative stance in extending credit to businesses by tightening loan standards, the Fed said. A survey of loan officers also indicated demand for home mortgages had cooled from three months ago.

> The decline in the euro to a record low of 88.52 U.S. cents may also be hurting shares of companies that sell goods and services to Europe, traders said. The euro rallied to 89.92 U.S.
cents in recent trading. "It's a negative influence on the stock market," said Arthur Cashin, PaineWebber Inc.'s director of floor operations at the NYSE. "U.S. goods will be more expensive in Europe."

> Cisco reported a quarter of its sales were made in Europe last year while Lucent Technologies made 31 percent of its sales in 2000 outside the U.S., according to Bloomberg analytics.

> Eastman Kodak Co., Procter & Gamble Co. and DuPont Co. have all attributed declines in revenue this year to a sagging euro.

The Federal Reserve last week tightened credit for the sixth time in 11 months, and hinted that more rate hikes lie ahead. Analysts expect difficulty for the market until the number and consequences of those hikes are known.

### Investor optimism rekindled by jobs data; Nasdaq, Dow surge higher


> NEW YORK (CNNfn) - Wall Street celebrated Main Street's misery Friday, after a key labor report showing slower-than-expected job growth sparked a searing rally that sent the Nasdaq composite index to its highest close in a month.

> The May unemployment report, which showed the first decline in hiring by U.S. companies in more than four years, would normally be seen as bad news.

> But in the current surging economy, where investors are nervous that the Federal Reserve will continue to raise interest rates to slow things down, the data prompted investors to snap up stocks at the open and never look back.

> The catalysts were clear. Reports showed that employment, the housing market and leading economic indicators all slowed. Manufacturing and construction spending also ebbed.

**Economic data draws in buyers**

> The Labor Department said unemployment rose to 4.1 percent in May from a 30-year low of 3.9 percent in April, while hourly wages rose only 0.1 percent, well below the 0.4 percent forecast. And there were only 231,000 new jobs created in May, which was well below Wall Street forecasts of 375,000. In fact, the additional jobs all came from government hiring and there was actually a decline in jobs in the private sector.

> NEW YORK (CNNfn) - The Nasdaq composite index capped off one of its worst weeks Friday, plunging more than 170 points, or more than 4 percent, as investors went on a selling spree -- betting that risky technology stocks could not continue to achieve strong revenue. The spree was apparently sparked by a negative outlook from American Power Conversion Corp.

![](./plots/earnings_2000-08-01.svg)

> Friday's economic data renewed concern that the Federal Reserve may not be done raising interest rates, prompting investors to dump rate-sensitive financial issues, sending the Dow Jones industrial average down nearly 1 percent.

> A government report showed gross domestic product for the second quarter growing at an annual rate of 5.2 percent, well above the 3.7 percent analysts anticipated. That accelerated the selling wave on the Dow.

**Investors spooked by revenue warnings**

> Warnings about corporate quarterly results drew attention again Friday, capping a week in which investors severely punished even the slightest downward deviation from expectations.

> American Power Conversion Corp. (APCC: Research, Estimates), a leading maker of power supplies and surge protectors for computers and other electronic gear, slumped 20-11/16 to 25-13/16 after it warned its third-quarter earnings will fall short of expectations.

**Investors wary of economic data**

> The Federal Reserve's monetary policy-making body meets again on August 22 and after six interest rate hikes over the past year, investors are hungry for any indications that the economy is slowing and the Fed is ending its tightening cycle.

> Besides the GDP growth rate, the report released by the Commerce Department showed that a key inflation gauge, the price deflator, rose 2.5 percent, in line with forecasts.

> "The good news is that on the consumer side of things, spending actually declined, and the real good news is the deflator was lower than the last quarter and there was a revision from the first quarter. So when you really dissect it all, it wasn't all that bad," said Peter Cardillo, director of research at Westfalia Investments.

> Evidence of an unexpectedly tight labor market, while good for Main Street, would make policy makers fret that employers will bid up wages, sparking an outbreak of inflation that could derail an economic expansion now in its record ninth year. But a slowdown in the job market might convince Fed officials that six credit tightenings since June, 1999, are beginning to bite.

### A spike in oil prices sends investors fleeing blue chips; Nasdaq falters

> NEW YORK (CNNfn) - The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled nearly 400 points Thursday, its sixth loss in as many sessions and its fifth-biggest point drop on record, after a surge in oil prices sparked fears that rising inflation could harm the economy. 

> Violence escalated in the Mideast, sending oil prices as high as $36 a barrel, in the latest blow to a market that has sold off steadily since Labor Day.

> Thursday's surge in oil prices to nearly 10-year highs, if it holds, could stall consumer spending and eat into corporate profitability. The gains come amid a market worried about slower earnings growth.

> Still, the market showed isolated areas of strength. Chip stocks rose after two semiconductor makers posted strong earnings. Oil shares gained with the price of the commodity. And drug stocks, among the year's best-performing sectors, continued drawing buyers.

**Oil gushes higher**

> The surge in the commodity hit a market already obsessed with how much the slowing economy will bite into profitability. Economists explaining the economy's 10-year expansion often cite the importance of cheap oil, which kept costs down and reduced inflation. Rising crude prices could threaten this growth rate.

**The rally must wait**

> Two key reads on the economy come Friday when the government reports on September retail sales and producer prices. Analysts surveyed by Briefing.com see retail sales gaining 0.4 percent in the month, twice August's 0.2 percent gain. And the producer price index is forecast to have risen 0.4 percent in September, after falling 0.2 percent the previous month.

"Stock prices have been so compressed that it give investors reason to step in and pick up stocks at depressed prices."

> "The volatility measures are falling with this snapback and there is a short-term shift in psychology -- there's a lot of bargain-hunting going on out there," said Terence Gabriel, stock market strategist at IDEAglobal.com.

> Jim Waggoner, market and technology strategist at Sands Brothers & Co., told CNNfn's In the Money that the Nasdaq rally may be the definitive sign of a change in investor psychology.

> Treasury securities rose. The dollar rose against both the euro and the yen.

### Money poured into battered tech sector; Dow ends month on high note

> NEW YORK (CNNfn) - The Nasdaq composite index bolted nearly 180 points higher Tuesday as investors snapped up beaten-down tech issues, betting that bargains were to be found, and that the worst is over for the sector.

> [Peter Cardillo, director of research at Westfalia Investment] "I think it's not a trick because I think the worst is over and the market is setting itself up for a nice rally."

> "Whether the catalyst was the cessation of tax selling or just a rally from a truly depressed area, the Nasdaq is attracting some bargain hunting," said Ned Riley, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. "I would suggest stocks were over discounting shorter-term problems that have already been announced."

> Treasurys were mixed. The dollar fell against the euro but was little changed versus the yen.

**Corporate news drives Dow's rise**

> While money was moving back into technology, investors were still betting that select "old economy" issues would provide safe havens for their money.

**Eyes on the election**

> Investors were also considering the national presidential election, which takes place in exactly one week. 

> And Westfalia's Cardillo said the markets were poised to rally once the election was out of the way. "After election day, the market is going to assess the political and economic outlook resulting from the election and that should set the stage for a nice year-end rally," he said.

> Among the day's economic indicators, new home sales surged 9.2 percent in September to an annual rate of 946,000, the government said. That's well above the 900,000 rate expected by analysts surveyed by Briefing.com and August's revised 866,000 level.

> Separately, the Consumer Confidence Index fell to 135.2 in October, the Conference Board said. The figures was well below forecasts of 140.0 and last month's 142.5 level.

> NEW YORK (CNNfn) - U.S. stocks entered November on a sour note Wednesday, showing signs of weakness, just one session after triple-digit gains, led by selling in the financial and telecom sectors.

**Economy and election eyed**

> After six interest rate hikes since June 1999, most of the incoming economic data have been pointing to a slowing economy, helping calm skittish investors.

> In the day's economic news, the National Association of Purchasing Management said its index of manufacturing activity fell for a third month in October. The NAPM index slid to 48.3, below forecasts of 49.5 and September's 49.9.

> "Overall there's nothing here that is going to get investors too upset," said Michael Lyons, senior trader with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "There's money going into the market and they're taking advantage of any weakness at this point."

> NEW YORK (CNNfn) - Positive guidance from leading chip maker Intel sent the Nasdaq composite index soaring nearly 100 points Thursday, as investors regained confidence in the tech sector.

> **A good portion of the money pouring back into the tech sector also came from mutual fund managers, who had sold tech stocks to offset capital gains before closing their books at the end of October.**

"We're still in the midst of a jittery market but it's a very fast moving market with a lot of volatility."

**Upbeat Intel powers tech buying**

### Warnings spark heavy tech sell-off, sending U.S. stocks plunging

> NEW YORK (CNNfn) - U.S. stock markets suffered triple-digit losses Thursday after revenue warnings from two key companies and weak economic data sparked a massive sell-off in technology stocks that sent the Nasdaq composite index to its lowest level in 15 months.

> "People that are overexposed in tech should rethink the thesis that many seem to hold that since stocks are down (significantly), they are going to shoot to the sky," said Bill Meehan, chief market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald. "Last year was an anomaly."

**Bears running rampant**

> Investors seemed to buy Meehan's point of view more than that of

> influential Goldman Sachs strategist Abby Joseph Cohen. Cohen, one of Wall Street's best known bulls, reiterated her 12-month forecast for the S&P at 1,650.

> Analysts say there are a bunch of key factors that have the hurt the markets over the past few months:

* Earnings and the economy: Worries and warnings that tech companies will not sustain a stellar pace of revenue growth in the wake of a slowing U.S. economy.
* Interest Rates: The Fed has raised interest rates six times over the last year and a half but has held the line in recent months amid signs of a slowdown. **With evidence mounting that the rate hikes have done their job, many market watchers are now hoping the Fed will either cut rates or at least shift its stance toward a more neutral position.** "I think what a lot of people would like to see out of that December (19 Fed) meeting is, is a change in the bias," Linda Jay, NYSE floor trader with RPM Specialists, told CNNfn's Market Call.
* Election Impasse: "What the election does is scare people and what people do when they're scared is stop buying," Jon Burnham, chairman and CEO with Burnham Securities, told CNNfn's market coverage.

**What goes down must come up**

> "I think you are near (capitulation) at the moment and you are getting close to the bottom," Richard Cripps, chief market strategist with Legg Mason Wood Walker, told CNNfn's In the Money. "Technology stocks are driven on the expectation and we're in a period now where expectations are being lowered. What you'll have happen is stocks will react to the fact that expectations are too low."

> "If you have any kind of cut or a neutral bias, the markets will move higher," Phil Dow, stock market strategist with Dain Rauscher Wessels, told CNNfn's market coverage.

**Economy still cooling**

> The Commerce Department reported that consumer spending edged up 0.2 percent in October, in line with forecasts, while Americans' incomes came in weaker than expected, falling 0.2 percent.

> The savings rate hit another record low of negative 0.8 percent. Separately, new jobless claims jumped to 358,000 last week, the highest in more than two years.

TBA: add jobless claims chart

> Investors will be keenly waiting for the November manufacturing report from the National Association of Purchasing Management index, due at 10 a.m. ET Friday. Briefing.com estimates the number will edge higher to 48.9 percent from the prior 48.3 percent. A figure above 50 points to growth in manufacturing, while one below that indicates contraction.

### Semis lead tech rally as investors seek bargains; financials boost the Dow

> NEW YORK (CNNfn) - The Nasdaq composite index rallied for the second straight session Monday, soaring above 3,000 for the first time in three weeks, as investors bet that most negative news about revenue growth has already been priced into these stocks.

> "If you really look at the action itself, most people in the market believe the worst is over, at least on a short-term basis," said Charles Payne, head analyst at Wall Street Strategies. "There's renewed hope that the presidential election is going to come to a conclusion and everyone is hoping the Fed is going to move to a neutral stance as a prelude to a series of decreasing the interest rates."

> "It has had a psychological effect so if we do get this thing settled, it will be a positive for the market," Edward Keon, director of quantitative research at Prudential Securities, told CNNfn's In the Money.

> Market breadth was positive and volume was strong with the Nasdaq seeing its seventh strongest day. Analysts said one of the contributing factors was that a lot of money being held by fund managers was finally entering the market.

**Tech surge led by semis**

> "What has happened over the past several months is valuations have come down a lot to where we think stocks are pretty reasonably valued here," said Prudential's Keon.

> "In the case of the tech sector, I think they've been so beaten up that I don't think there's much more negative news that can hurt it," Linda Jay, NYSE floor specialist with RPM Specialists, told CNNfn's Market Call.

### Renewed concern about tech revenue hurts Nasdaq; J.P. Morgan bruises Dow

> NEW YORK (CNNfn) - Once again, worries and warnings about corporate revenue growth sent U.S. stocks reeling Thursday, led by financial and technology stocks.

> The beleaguered tech sector, hurt by a recent spate of results warnings, continued to feel selling pressure, sending the Nasdaq composite index sharply lower for its third straight session -- a sign that many of the tech leaders are still seen as carrying too high a price tag in a slowing economy.

> The day's economic data appeared to have little impact on the markets. The November Producer Price Index, a measure of the price of goods at the wholesale level, came in line with expectations -- another sign that the Federal Reserve may temper its stance on inflation at its next monetary policy-making meeting on Dec. 19.

**Results warnings are just beginning**

> With the floodgates opening to corporate warnings, the day's action on the Dow was dictated by an announcement from merging financial services companies, Chase Manhattan (CMB: Research, Estimates) and indicator component J.P. Morgan (JPM: Research, Estimates). They jointly warned that fourth-quarter profit would be lower than analysts' forecasts and around 5,000 jobs would be cut.

> "All the bad news is not out yet, and I don't know if we're going to have another round of estimate reductions because the economy seems to be falling away far faster than any of us would expect," Vince Farrell, chief investment officer at Spears Benzak Salomon & Farrell, told CNNfn's Ahead of the Curve.

> "This market has got problems and it's got earnings problems and it has not discounted yet," said Weatherly's Hyman. "You have to expect to be bombarded every day by more earnings warnings in technology."

> Robert Harrington, head of listed equity trading at UBS Warburg, told CNNfn's market coverage said the sell-off has created a tremendous buying opportunity

**Eyes turn to economy**

> "Inflation is not the problem; growth is," said Weatherly's Hyman.

> One sign that the economy may not be as weak as some fear: The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits for the week ended Dec. 9 was 320,000, down from a revised 352,000 for the week before, the U.S. Labor Department reported Thursday. Economists polled by Briefing.com had forecast claims of 355,000 for the period.

> Before the market opens Friday, the closely watched consumer price index (CPI) for November will be reported. Expectations are for the index to remain unchanged at 0.2 percent.

> NEW YORK (CNNfn) - The Nasdaq composite index tumbled to its lowest levels in 16 months Tuesday after the Federal Reserve delayed any interest rate cut until next year.

> Saying it was concerned about the slowing economy, the Fed declined to lower borrowing costs. The decision preserves some of the highest rates in a decade rates partially responsible for handing the Nasdaq what could be its worst year on record.
