## [Wall St. hit by Cohen](https://money.cnn.com/2000/03/28/markets/markets_newyork/)
### Strategist's portfolio juggling spooks investors as Nasdaq and Dow fall

> NEW YORK (CNNfn) - Investors heeded one of Wall Street's best-known market strategists Tuesday, reducing stock positions after Abby Joseph Cohen advised such a move.

> Cohen, investment strategist at Goldman Sachs, also warned that high-flying technology shares might not have much room left to grow.

> But in a quiet news period after the Federal Reserve's latest interest-rate hike and ahead of first-quarter earnings reporting season, analysts said Cohen's comments met a market looking any reasons to buy or sell.

**Waiting for OPEC**

> Wall Street again watched OPEC Tuesday. After the close of trading, the 11-nation oil cartel once again failed to reach consensus on crude-oil production.

> The standstill comes as oil prices tripled during the last 12 months, a development analysts fear could hurt profits across many industries and spark an outbreak of inflation.
