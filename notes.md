> Cohen, investment strategist at Goldman Sachs, also warned that high-flying technology shares might not have much room left to grow.

> But in a quiet news period after the Federal Reserve's latest interest-rate hike and ahead of first-quarter earnings reporting season, analysts said Cohen's comments met a market looking any reasons to buy or sell.

> Wall Street focused more closely on news that the unemployment rate did not fall as expected, but held steady at 4.1 percent. Wage inflation, meanwhile, did not rise with any significance, climbing 0.4 percent.

## U.S. Stock-Index Futures Rise as Report Shows April Retail Sales Fell (Bloomberg)

> New York, May 11 (Bloomberg) - U.S. stocks gained after a report showed April retail sales dropped from the month before. The report eased some concerns that strong consumer spending could spur inflation and push interest rates higher.

> Intel Corp. and Cisco Systems Inc., the largest companies in the Nasdaq Composite Index, rose. The report showed sales at U.S. retailers fell last month for the first time in a year and a half.

> The unexpected drop in retail sales "gives a sign that the economy is starting to slow a little," said Richard Cripps, chief market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker in Baltimore. "The
Fed won't have to be as aggressive."

> The Federal Reserve is expected to raise short-term interest rates by as much as half a point on May 16. "A 50 basis-point rise looks factored into the market now," said Jacques-Antoine Bretteil, who helps manage $700 million at International Capital Gestion in Paris. "If the Fed raises rates more than that the market will really take a blow." Rising interest rates tend to penalize stocks that are most expensive relative to their earnings, he said.

## U.S. Stocks Fall, Led by Intel, GE; Nasdaq Composite Loses 3.9% for Week (Bloomberg)

> New York, May 19 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. stocks fell, led by Intel Corp. and General Electric Co., on expectations the Federal Reserve will keep raising interest rates this year, slowing the economy and reducing corporate revenue and profit growth. 
"Investors have been justifying paying extraordinary prices for tech stocks because of the expectation for continued revenue growth," said Charles Crane, market strategist at Spears, Benzak, Salomon & Farrell Inc., which manages $5 billion. "Any threat to that growth" puts technology shares in trouble.

> The Nasdaq fell three straight days, with technology shares leading the losses, after the Federal Reserve said Tuesday it will raise interest rates to hold inflation in check, even as it boosted rates for the sixth time since June. 
"Tech companies themselves aren't heavy borrowers, but their customers are going to be hurt by higher interest rates" and reduce spending on technology, said Crane.

> Cisco fell 1 15/16 to 53 7/16 and was the most active stock, as it has been every day this week. The No. 1 computer-networking equipment maker, which rose 50 percent in the first three months of the year, has wiped out all of that gain and is now the third most valuable company in the S&P; 500 behind General Electric Co. and Intel.
**"I sold the last of my Cisco yesterday," said Johan Vystavel, a fund manager at HWB Capital Management, in Surrey, England. "I got out above purchase price. It's a good company, but at 100 times earnings it's just too expensive."** The shares trade for 103 times profit.

> U.S. commercial banks themselves are taking a more conservative stance in extending credit to businesses by tightening loan standards, the Fed said. A survey of loan officers also indicated demand for home mortgages had cooled from three months ago.

> The decline in the euro to a record low of 88.52 U.S. cents may also be hurting shares of companies that sell goods and services to Europe, traders said. The euro rallied to 89.92 U.S.
cents in recent trading. "It's a negative influence on the stock market," said Arthur Cashin, PaineWebber Inc.'s director of floor operations at the NYSE. "U.S. goods will be more expensive in Europe."

> Cisco reported a quarter of its sales were made in Europe last year while Lucent Technologies made 31 percent of its sales in 2000 outside the U.S., according to Bloomberg analytics.

> Eastman Kodak Co., Procter & Gamble Co. and DuPont Co. have all attributed declines in revenue this year to a sagging euro.

> **Though the Nasdaq has lost a third of its value since its March 10 record, individual investors haven't lost their appetite for stock mutual funds, according to research firm TrimTabs.com. 
An estimated $13.1 billion flowed into U.S. stock funds in the week ended Wednesday, up from $5.2 billion the previous week, TrimTabs said.**

> NEW YORK (CNNfn) - The Nasdaq composite index tumbled to its lowest close of the year Tuesday and wiped out all of its gains since early November, as fears grew that higher interest rates will hurt earnings.

> The losses came exactly one week after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates and warned that even steeper borrowing costs may lie ahead.

**Techs keep falling**

> The Nasdaq's steady losses since March 10, when the gauge hit a record high of 5,048.62, come as interest rates have jumped to their highest levels in nine years. The Federal Reserve last week tightened credit for the sixth time in 11 months, and hinted that more rate hikes lie ahead. Analysts expect difficulty for the market until the number and consequences of those hikes are known.

### Investor optimism rekindled by jobs data; Nasdaq, Dow surge higher


> NEW YORK (CNNfn) - Wall Street celebrated Main Street's misery Friday, after a key labor report showing slower-than-expected job growth sparked a searing rally that sent the Nasdaq composite index to its highest close in a month.

> The May unemployment report, which showed the first decline in hiring by U.S. companies in more than four years, would normally be seen as bad news.

> But in the current surging economy, where investors are nervous that the Federal Reserve will continue to raise interest rates to slow things down, the data prompted investors to snap up stocks at the open and never look back.

> The catalysts were clear. Reports showed that employment, the housing market and leading economic indicators all slowed. Manufacturing and construction spending also ebbed.

**Economic data draws in buyers**

> The Labor Department said unemployment rose to 4.1 percent in May from a 30-year low of 3.9 percent in April, while hourly wages rose only 0.1 percent, well below the 0.4 percent forecast. And there were only 231,000 new jobs created in May, which was well below Wall Street forecasts of 375,000. In fact, the additional jobs all came from government hiring and there was actually a decline in jobs in the private sector.

> NEW YORK (CNNfn) - The Nasdaq composite index capped off one of its worst weeks Friday, plunging more than 170 points, or more than 4 percent, as investors went on a selling spree -- betting that risky technology stocks could not continue to achieve strong revenue. The spree was apparently sparked by a negative outlook from American Power Conversion Corp.

> Friday's economic data renewed concern that the Federal Reserve may not be done raising interest rates, prompting investors to dump rate-sensitive financial issues, sending the Dow Jones industrial average down nearly 1 percent.

> A government report showed gross domestic product for the second quarter growing at an annual rate of 5.2 percent, well above the 3.7 percent analysts anticipated. That accelerated the selling wave on the Dow.

**Investors spooked by revenue warnings**

> Warnings about corporate quarterly results drew attention again Friday, capping a week in which investors severely punished even the slightest downward deviation from expectations.

> American Power Conversion Corp. (APCC: Research, Estimates), a leading maker of power supplies and surge protectors for computers and other electronic gear, slumped 20-11/16 to 25-13/16 after it warned its third-quarter earnings will fall short of expectations.

**Investors wary of economic data**

> The Federal Reserve's monetary policy-making body meets again on August 22 and after six interest rate hikes over the past year, investors are hungry for any indications that the economy is slowing and the Fed is ending its tightening cycle.

> Besides the GDP growth rate, the report released by the Commerce Department showed that a key inflation gauge, the price deflator, rose 2.5 percent, in line with forecasts.

> "The good news is that on the consumer side of things, spending actually declined, and the real good news is the deflator was lower than the last quarter and there was a revision from the first quarter. So when you really dissect it all, it wasn't all that bad," said Peter Cardillo, director of research at Westfalia Investments.

### A spike in oil prices sends investors fleeing blue chips; Nasdaq falters

> NEW YORK (CNNfn) - The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled nearly 400 points Thursday, its sixth loss in as many sessions and its fifth-biggest point drop on record, after a surge in oil prices sparked fears that rising inflation could harm the economy. 

> Violence escalated in the Mideast, sending oil prices as high as $36 a barrel, in the latest blow to a market that has sold off steadily since Labor Day.

> Thursday's surge in oil prices to nearly 10-year highs, if it holds, could stall consumer spending and eat into corporate profitability. The gains come amid a market worried about slower earnings growth.

> Still, the market showed isolated areas of strength. Chip stocks rose after two semiconductor makers posted strong earnings. Oil shares gained with the price of the commodity. And drug stocks, among the year's best-performing sectors, continued drawing buyers.

**Oil gushes higher**

> The surge in the commodity hit a market already obsessed with how much the slowing economy will bite into profitability. Economists explaining the economy's 10-year expansion often cite the importance of cheap oil, which kept costs down and reduced inflation. Rising crude prices could threaten this growth rate.

**The rally must wait**

> Two key reads on the economy come Friday when the government reports on September retail sales and producer prices. Analysts surveyed by Briefing.com see retail sales gaining 0.4 percent in the month, twice August's 0.2 percent gain. And the producer price index is forecast to have risen 0.4 percent in September, after falling 0.2 percent the previous month.
